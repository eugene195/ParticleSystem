ParticleSystem
==============

My Computer Graphics (CG) course project
A project developed at BMSTU on my third year of studying.
This project demonstrates a "Particle Flow" method, widely used in CG for modelling.

The system of particles can be transformed using base transformation methods: matrices and quaternions.
