Particle System
==============

My Computer Graphics (CG) course project
A project is developed at BMSTU on my third year of studying.
This project demonstrates a "Particle Flow" method, widely used in CG when modelling objects without precise geometrical border.

Particle system consists of Emitters - classes, which implement particle birth, Fields - typical field from Physics.
Emitters specify particle properties. Fields can be used to change particle path. Particles are basically points which have a mass.

To give user a full overview of a system, I use different scene transformation methods:

1. Quaternions
2. matrices

The problem I tried to study is: "How bad are matricx rotations compared to quaternion rotations"
